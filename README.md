# Colour_Picker
A Random Colour Picker

Allows a user to pick random colours.

- The user presses the first button to generate a new colour, the background of the button changes to that colour.
- The user can hover over the second button and scroll down on a mouse to pick new colours (Desktop Only).
- The colour's rgb code, got from the buttons, gets stored in the input field below the buttons. 
- The user can press the copy button and the rgb code is copied to be used for their own personal use.
